This is an ATM CLI.  
I had some help from a guide.  
In the setup, a user can create and account and password, which are used to log in and access the ATM functionality.

The PIN is hashed and checked for validation, and account numbers are randomly generated.
Users have a checking and a savings account and can withdraw, deposit, transfer, see a history report, and log out.
